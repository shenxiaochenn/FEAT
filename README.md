**FEAT is a modular, multi-agent architecture for forensic cause-of-death analysis that transforms heterogeneous inputs into transparent, auditable conclusions.**
*A Planner* ingests case materials (basic demographics, pathological anatomy, toxicology, scene notes) and performs self-discovered task decomposition, sequencing subtasks and routing them to role-specific Local Solvers. 
*Local Solvers* apply tool-augmented ReAct reasoning to generate intermediate findings and rationales for their assigned domains (e.g., pathology, toxicology, clinical history).
*A Reflection & Memory module* monitors progress, critiques outputs, caches evidence, and iteratively refines hypotheses to reduce error propagation. 
*A Global Solver* then consolidates solver outputs using hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation over a curated Chinese-language medicolegal corpus, combined with locally fine-tuned LLMs, to synthesize a long-form analysis and a concise cause-of-death conclusion with evidence traceability.

**Overview of the FEAT system and data.** (a) Category composition of the six evaluation cohorts (C1--C6). Stacked bars show the percentage distribution across cause-of-death categories (legend at right; cohort case counts labeled at left). (b) The system is: (1) FEAT ingests multi-source materials. (2) The Planner decomposes the case into a hierarchical plan and adapts it to the instance. (3) Local Solvers, coordinated by a Router, follow a ReAct cycle to generate evidence-grounded findings using resources such as a forensic textbook/vector store, PubMed retrieval, websites, and a medical LLM; an Executor synthesizes subtask results. (4) Reflection \& Memory maintains a dynamic case file, audits intermediate outputs for completeness and consistency, and triggers replanning when gaps or contradictions are detected---forming an iterative loop. (5) The Global Solver performs collaborative summarization and employs hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation to retrieve similar cases and authoritative references; with optional human-in-the-loop review, it invokes a Forensic-LLM to produce court-ready outputs: a long-form analysis and a short-form conclusion.
