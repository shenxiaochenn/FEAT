**FEAT is a modular, multi-agent architecture for forensic cause-of-death analysis that transforms heterogeneous inputs into transparent, auditable conclusions.**
*A Planner* ingests case materials (basic demographics, pathological anatomy, toxicology, scene notes) and performs self-discovered task decomposition, sequencing subtasks and routing them to role-specific Local Solvers. 
*Local Solvers* apply tool-augmented ReAct reasoning to generate intermediate findings and rationales for their assigned domains (e.g., pathology, toxicology, clinical history).
*A Reflection & Memory module* monitors progress, critiques outputs, caches evidence, and iteratively refines hypotheses to reduce error propagation. 
*A Global Solver* then consolidates solver outputs using hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation over a curated Chinese-language medicolegal corpus, combined with locally fine-tuned LLMs, to synthesize a long-form analysis and a concise cause-of-death conclusion with evidence traceability.
